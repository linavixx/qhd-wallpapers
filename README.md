Why (or why not) this over anything else out of hundreds of wallpaper repos on GitHub?
</h4>

- Do you like looking at stretched pixels and JPEG artifacts? Me neither. That's why everything in here will be at **1440p** or higher, sometimes achieved via upscaling. Though, it comes with a downside - the repo is big, approaching 600 files and 3GiB size at the moment. A huge portion of the stuff actually reaches or surpasses 4K, and something that doesn't will almost certainly be a good fit for upscaling.

## **Some other rules I follow here:**
-  **Strictly SFW.** Self-explanatory.
-  **Tagging.** Every wallpaper here will have its category specified in the title. This is useful for searching: for example, if you use Rofi as a wallpaper selector.

 ### **Categories:**
 - **Abstract:** Self-explanatory.
 - **Monochrome:** Black-and-white of any variety.
 - **Anime:** Anything taken from an anime or drawn in an anime-resembling style.
 - **Illustration:** Artworks or renders that don't fit abstract or anime criteria.
 - **Pixel:** Artworks or renders in a pixel-art style.
 - **Urban:** Anything taken in real life within a distinct urban environment.
 - **Nature:** Anything taken in real life with nature in the focus.
