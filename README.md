QHD-Wallpapers
 <h5 align="center">
This is my collection of wallpapers taken from various sources (but mainly Wallhaven and Unsplash) that I'll frequently update. Strictly for personal use, nothing in this repo is owned by me or affiliated with me in any way. If you're the creator of a picture and you want it removed or credited, contact me and I'll get it sorted out. Enjoy!

## **A couple rules I follow here:**
-  **Strictly 1440p or above.** If there's a picture that did not exist in 1440p+, it means I upscaled it. Don't worry about the quality, I won't upload something that upscales poorly.
-  **Strictly SFW.** Self-explanatory.
-  **Color tagging:** To simplify searching, I'll put the predominant color in the title of every wallpaper here.

 ### **Categories:**
 - **Abstract:** Self-explanatory.
 - **Monochrome:** Black-and-white, illustrated or not.
 - **Anime:** Anything taken from an anime or drawn in a similar style.
 -  **Illustration:** Artworks or renders that don't fit abstract or anime criteria.
 -  **Pixel:** Artworks or renders in a pixel-art style.
 -  **Urban:** Real-life pictures of cities.
 -  **Nature:** Real-life pictures of nature.
